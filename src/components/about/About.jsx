        For the past few years, I have been working as a food and beverage
        business developer. I have always loved learning new things and
        developing my skills, so when I found out about web development, I was
        immediately interested. I taught myself how to code and design websites,
        and eventually made the switch to becoming a full-time web developer. I
        am constantly striving to learn new techniques and keep up with the
        latest trends in web development. feel free to contact me â€“ I would be
        happy to chat with you about it!
